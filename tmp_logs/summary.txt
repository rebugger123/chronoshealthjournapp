  ‚Ä¢ hermes.framework embedded: YES (despite Podfile settings)
  ‚Ä¢ App installed to simulator: YES
  ‚Ä¢ App stayed open: NO - App crashed immediately after launch

‚ùå CRASH ANALYSIS:
  ‚Ä¢ App launched with PID 67572
  ‚Ä¢ Process terminated within 3 seconds
  ‚Ä¢ Crash location: RNSScreenNavigationContainer.mm (react-native-screens)
  ‚Ä¢ Thread: com.facebook.react.ExceptionsManagerQueue
  ‚Ä¢ Root cause: Fatal JavaScript exception in ExceptionsManager
  ‚Ä¢ Hermes threads active: YES ("hades" GC thread present in crash)

üîç ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The app crashes due to USE_HERMES configuration mismatch:
  1. Podfile sets :hermes_enabled => false (JSC expected)
  2. project.pbxproj has USE_HERMES = true in Debug+Release configs (user reverted)
  3. Hermes framework is being embedded and initialized
  4. main.jsbundle was built for JSC (--dev false, no hermes bytecode)
  5. Conflict between Hermes engine loading and JSC bundle causes crash

üîß FIX REQUIRED:
Set USE_HERMES = NO in ios/ChronosApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj for ALL configurations (Debug+Release)
to match Podfile settings, then rebuild.
